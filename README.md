## Current Features

* Theme selection
* Current date display

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node 12 or greater is installed
* Your favorite package manager (Yarn will be used in the example)

### Installing

To get started after cloning the repo, we'll get any required packages installed:

```Shell
yarn install
```

### Running and Developing

Next we'll get it up and running locally so we can work on any future changes:

```Shell
yarn dev
```

## Contribution

Since this is a learning project meant to work with Eleventy, a more minimal javascript framework that relies on templating engines, I don't recommend contributing to this directly. Feel free to fork and build on it with your own spin!
